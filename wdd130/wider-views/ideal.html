                        <p>Son of renowned thinker Gabor Maté, Aaron's
                        passion was journalism. After confronting questions of
                        his own Jewish identity, he proceeded to chase
                        unpopular stories and defend unlikely victims
                        far from his Canadian homeground.  Now he contributes
                        his keen, equal-opportunity critical analysis to
                        television and on-line sites.</p>

                        <p>Russell first made a name for himself with his
                        high-speed brand of British quirkiness and excess
                        before finding, as others before him, that comedy
                        drags you toward the sharper problems of human nature.
                        Now employing his sometimes rough humour on his
                        on-line channels, he takes on all topics in his quest
                        to bring out the best in himself and the world.</p>
